## Installation ##

ssh to MACHINE
su to user root

/bin/bash

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/clecap/dante-wiki/raw/refs/heads/master/dist/get.sh)"


dante/dist/run.sh


Security Concepts:

CASE 1: Public installation

CASE 2: Private installation

ISSUE: configuration.sh must be readable by the docker process but not readable by other users on the machine
