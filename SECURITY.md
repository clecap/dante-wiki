## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us by doing the following steps:

1. **Do not** open a public issue on the GitHub repository. This makes the vulnerability immediately visible to the public and could pose a security risk.
2. **Send an email** to the owner of the repository with the details of the vulnerability. Include as much information as possible to help us understand and replicate the issue.
3. **Expect an acknowledgment** within 96 hours. If you do not receive an acknowledgment within this time frame, please follow up.

Please include the following details in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- The steps required to reproduce the issue.
- Any other relevant information or background.

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly. Once we receive a report, we will:
1. Confirm the vulnerability.
2. Determine the impact and severity.
3. Prepare and release a patch as soon as possible.
