# Patches in this repository

This repository contains a few patches of the MediaWiki extension DrawEditor https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:DrawioEditor


## 1. Fix path setting in ext.drawioeditor.js:

The path setting mechanism in `$wgDrawioEditorBackendUrl` in the original is constructed in a way to conform
the requirements of the Dockerfile described in https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio. This Dockerfile assumes the
existence of a Tomcat server which redirects a directory URL to an index.html file.

In our installation we do not use this Dockerfile but employ a more light-weight installation. Therefore
we remove the slash before the `?embed` in `src: this.baseUrl + '?embed=1&proto=json&spin=1&analytics=0&picker=0&lang=' + this.language + localAttr`
in line 52 of `ext.draweditor.js`. This allows us to specify a file as endpoint in `$wgDrawioEditorBackendUrl`.

In my test-installation this amounts to `$wgDrawioEditorBackendUrl="http://localhost:8080/experiments/drawio-dev/src/main/webapp/index.html";`

This is fixed by my commit https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-DrawioEditor/commit/037e684fc9968244b60e9183249ae8b97c59c93f

## 2. Do Due Diligence

Given the problems described in https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:DrawioEditor, it is recommendable to check whether you have done the following:
* Allow upload of files in the wiki configuration
* Allow upload of filetype `svg` in wiki configuration
* Check if the file indeed shows up in image directory

## 3. Patch bug in ext.drawioeditor.js

In file `ext.drawioeditor.js` the error reporting is broken in function `DrawioEditor.prototype.uploadToWiki`. Therefore,
the extension does not properly report errors and exceptions caused by the MediaWiki system.

This bug needs adding an additional case and error output in line 218 of `ext.draweditor.js`.

This is fixed by my commit https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-DrawioEditor/commit/037e684fc9968244b60e9183249ae8b97c59c93f


## 4. Fix includes/libs/ParamValidator/Util/UploadedFile.php

When the error reporting is fixed as above, one indeed gets to see some errors which still exist MediaWiki in file `includes/libs/ParamValidator/Util/UploadedFile.php`.

`Declaration of Wikimedia\ParamValidator\Util\UploadedFile::getStream() must be compatible with Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface::getStream(): 
Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface in <b>/var/www/html/wiki-dir/includes/libs/ParamValidator/Util/UploadedFile.php</b> on line <b>86</b><br />`

### Patches to be done to MediaWiki core file `includes/libs/ParamValidator/Util/UploadedFile.php`
* The function `getStream()` in line 86 lacks the specification StreamInterface:  `public function getStream(): StreamInterface`
* The function `moveTo($targetPath)`in line 96 lacks the specification `moveTo(string $targetPath): void`
* The functtion `getSize()` in line 121 lacks the specification `?int`
* The function `getError()` in line 125 lacks the specification `int`
* The function `getClientFilename()`in line 129 lacks the specification `?string`
* The function `getClientMediaType()`in line 134 lacks the specification `?string`
* Moreover PHP requires path access to the proper file describing `StreamInterface`, so we must add 
`use Psr\Http\Message\StreamInterface;`to the header in this file.

The correct file is supplied here as PATCH-UploadedFile.php (for MediaWiki 1.40).

## 5. Further Bug:

We need to do a reload after we return from the editor to the Wikipage.

This has been fixed by an add on to `DrawioEditor.prototype.exit` in ext.drawioeditor.js

## 6. Extension.json

* Changed `config.DrawioEditorImageType` to "svg"
* Changed `DrawioEditorBackendUrl.value`to "" to prevent any use outside of the configuration which is done in DanteSettings.php


## 7. Type bug

In file `src/Hook/ApprovedRevsSetStableFile.php` we remove the type specification Ã¹ser`at variable `$user`
in `public function onDrawioGetFile( File &$file, &$latestIsStable, User $user, bool &$isNotApproved, &$displayFile )`
as this produces errors in `danteEndpoint.php` previews.

## 8. Patch to MediaWiki core file includes/upload/UploadBase.php

drawio uses namespace "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" in text portions, MediaWiki in the current version (1.39) disallows upload 
of SVG files using this namespace, as xhtml can be used to embed iframes, which can be used for XSS attacks by untrusted users.
As a result, drawio SVG uploads get rejected by MediaWiki.

The issue has been described in https://github.com/mgeb/mediawiki-drawio-editor/issues/1

A request for modification of MediaWiki has been discussed in https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/SVG_Upload_should_(optionally)_allow_the_xhtml_namespace and
in https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/03/01/2 

The request has been rejected thus far here https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T62771 for at least MediaWiki mainstream.

To solve the problem, we patch file includes/upload/Uploadbase.php by adding 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml' in into static variable $validNamespaces.

The file PATCH-UploadBase.php must be copied into the respective place.

# Differences in Usage

<drawio filenae="some-name" /> also works
