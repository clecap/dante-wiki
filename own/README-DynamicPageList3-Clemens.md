DynamicPageList3 is the best DynamicPageList extension, but the community has a horrible discipline of
fixing bugs and is often late adjusting to new Mediawiki versions.

This version here is my onw quick and dirty patch.

DynamicPageList3 is REL1_38 from the main distribution 
with the patches fromhttps://github.com/alistair3149/DynamicPageList3/commit/99692dbb0ffd060ce6f63bb198b28666786f32cf
applied.

All this is just a quick and dirty hack to get things runnign.
